                        <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded nearly 200 years ago. The Restoration of this great church and the Gospel of Jesus Christ began in the early 1800’s. It was a time of religious freedom, but that did not stop the saints of the church from being persecuted against in all times and places. There were times of peace, but for the early members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints tribulation was the norm.</p>
                        <p>In The New Testament, in Matthew 5:10-12, Jesus taught: “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
                        <p>Persecution against member of Christ’s true and living church is not a new thing. John W. Welch did a study where he compared the early days of the restored church with Christ’s New Testament church. He found many interesting similarities. One of these was in how the members and leaders of Christ’s church were often reviled against, imprisoned and even killed for their faith. “Blessed are they which are persecuted.”</p>
                        <p>We can all learn from those who went before us. This website is organized into four main sections of the early church. In each of these sections different stories will be shared from the history of the church as found in Saints: Volume 1 and other church history sources. Seek to gain faith and strength as you read about how our forebearers supported trials and held strong to their faith!</p>
